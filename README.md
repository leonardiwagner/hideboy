Features
=====

1. Encrypt and decrypt text, using both private and public keys.
2. Very simple and lightweight cryptography (less than 100 code lines) but it's very functional.
3. Easy to learn, made for beginners. You can use it as your academic project.
4. Easy to customize. You can also use it as startup for a more complex cryptography.

Can I use this for serious business?
=====
First of all, I'm not a cryptography or security expert, so I did it on my own for an (old) academic project, thus I didn't recommend that. However is safe enough for an academic project.
